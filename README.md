# This project has 2 files, the Server and the Client. The server application is responsible for listening to incoming data from clients. 
# It uses socket programming to establish a connection, receive data, and then process or display this data, potentially in a graphical user interface (GUI).
# The client sends data to the server. This data could be any kind of information, possibly sensor readings or computed results, and is formatted and sent over a network connection to the server.
